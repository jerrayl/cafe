# React App Template: Cafe

This simple app allows users to order single menu items with their name, 
which can be seen by admins. 

It showcases basic react functional components (useState, useEffect), javascript functions (map, filter), routing, and tailwind.

It doesn't contain any backend, but API.js approximates what an api integration might look like in a production app.
